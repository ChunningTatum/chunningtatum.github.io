        <h2>Lockdown air pollution</h2>
        <p>In the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic, every country in the 
            world took strong measures to contain the virus. Because 
            car- and air-traffic were reduced by a lot the air was a 
            lot cleaner as a result. Because of these measures, the 
            KNMI wanted to develop a interactive and insightful tool 
            for politicians and other people, so people can understand 
            how collective behaviour can greatly reduce air pollution. 
            The reduction in air pollution is easy to measure with the 
            Dutch TROPOMI satellite, that the KNMI is supervising. The 
            satellite has been measuring the world on air pollution 
            since 2018 from space. From a provisional analysis of the 
            lockdown, the cities in South-Europe and Paris were 60% 
            cleaner compared to the years before the pandemic. Of 
            course, not every city had the same effect, because not 
            every place had the same measurements.

            <h3>How do we design a data visualisation for policy makers and the general public?</h3>
            <p>Our initial idea is to collect data regarding Covid-19 
                infections and measurements during a certain time frame. 
                After getting enough data and information, we started 
                brainstorming and sketching different ideas. 
                The table to the right is a collection of all the data we 
                have collected. The developer made a small slider for us
                to decide the country's we would measure against each
                other.
