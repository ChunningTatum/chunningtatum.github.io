        <h2>Lockdown air pollution</h2>
        <p>The KNMI approached us to develop an <strong>interactive and insightful tool</strong> 
          for politicians and the general public to understand <strong>the impact of collective 
          behavior on air pollution.</strong> With the reduction in car and air traffic during 
          the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the air became significantly cleaner. 
          <strong>Utilizing data from the Dutch TROPOMI satellite,</strong> which has been 
          measuring air pollution globally since 2018, we were able to <strong>analyze the effects 
          of the lockdown on various cities.</strong> From our provisional analysis, we found 
          that cities in South-Europe and Paris were 60% cleaner compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
          However, it is important to note that <strong>not all cities had the same level of 
          reduction,</strong> as measurements varied in different areas. Our goal is to create 
          <strong>a user-friendly tool</strong> that effectively communicates these findings and 
          <strong>educates users on the impact of their actions on air pollution.</strong>

            <h3>How do we visualise data for policy makers and the general public?</h3>
            <p>Our initial idea is to collect data regarding Covid-19 
                infections and measurements during a certain time frame. 
                After getting enough data and information, we started 
                brainstorming and sketching different ideas. 
                The table to the right is a collection of all the data we 
                have collected. The developer made a small slider for us
                to decide the country's we would measure against each
                other.

            <h3>Concept iteration 1</h3>
            <p>For our first concept, we wanted to paint a story for the 
                user. First we would introduce background information 
                about NO2 and we would ask the user some questions. The 
                user would then choose a country, where we would then 
                give them some data regarding Covid-19 in the country, 
                the average NO2 emissions in the chosen country and a 
                lot more of the data sets we have found.

            <h3>Concept iteration 2</h3>
            <p>Based on the feedback we had received, we mainly focused on 
                comparing the two cities from different continents. We decided
                to put off the narrative part for now and started looking 
                for a style in which we wanted to design our concept. In 
                iteration 2, we shifted the focus from policy makers and the 
                general public to policy makers only. the client stated that
                the user is mainly interested in finding connections in data, 
                and this is also something a policy maker would like to do.
                By focussing on only one target group, our focus was clear.

                <li>How do you show the comparison between Covid-19 measures?</li>
                <li>Give the user some explanation because the interaction is unique (but very cool).</li>

            <h3>Concept iteration 3</h3>
            <p>In this iteration we have added a tutorial page that explains 
                how our comparison tool works. We have done this because our 
                graph is very complex and we can better guide the user with it.
                We also intergrated the storytelling part of the concept.
