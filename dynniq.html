                <p>Dynniq Energy focuses on improving energy supplies. This includes
                    the distribution of cables and pipelines to neighborhoods and
                    households, as well as the engineering and construction of
                    high-voltage network stations. The company is a recognized player
                    in enhancing the electricity grid to achieve a low-carbon energy
                    economy. Major customers include network operators such as Liander,
                    Stedin, and TenneT. Since 2019, Dynniq Energy B.V. has been operating
                    independently in the Dutch energy market. Note: I signed a NDA, I am not
                    able to show a lot of things here.</p>

            </article>
            <article id="descriptive">
                <p>OPCIS is a business management system that can communicate with
                    <a href="https://wiki.dsplatform.nl/index.php/Hoofdpagina" target="_blank">DSP</a>,
                    where all the energy grid operators communicate with. As an example, when 
                    OPCIS receives a task  from Liander, it generates a work order, which is 
                    then assigned to a mechanic. Since the application is built on an old 
                    framework (Java JSF v8), it was more efficient to address the mechanic 
                    flow first, ensuring that changes wouldn't impact other components of OPCIS. 
                    My role at the OPCIS team was to prepare and implement the redesign for the Heijmans 
                    acquisition and simultaneously improve the platform's user experience and provide
                    support as a DevOps engineer.
