        <h2>The Game Changer</h2>
        <p>Sleep is important, that is the time the body recovers. 
            In order to function the body needs to rest, the 
            required amount of sleep is 8.5 hours for adults. 
            6 Hours is considered the absolute minimum, but only 
            few are aware of that. Sleep deprived people often 
            find it hard to concentrate and have a higher chance 
            of depression, heart diseases and obesity. A lot of 
            people don’t get enough hours of sleep. Gerard Kerkhof, 
            professor at the UvA conducted a research and found out 
            that the people in the Netherlands sleep 7 hours at night 
            on average. Also, one third of the population sleeps less 
            than 6 hours. Besides, 33 per cent mentioned that they 
            regularly (more than 3 times per week) are having 
            trouble sleeping.

            <h3>What if we could improve the sleep of your child and manage game time?</h3>
            <p>But what if your child doesn’t want to play anymore but 
                your child also does not want to waste the time that is 
                left. By simply pressing the head of the chicken the 
                timer will stop and the remaining time will be saved. 
                Your child is then able to use the saved up time on a 
                different date.

                The Game Changer is a physical product, designed as a 
                chicken. You as the parent can clock in how much time 
                your child is allowed to play per session. After 
                clocking in, the glasses will show how much game time 
                is left. If the timer reaches closer to zero, the 
                chicken will make some noise, indicating that play time 
                is soon over. As the timer reaches zero, the electricity 
                to the gaming console will be cut.
