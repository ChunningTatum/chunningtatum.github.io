        <p>Sleep is crucial for the body’s recovery and overall function.
          Adults need about 8.5 hours of sleep each night, with 6 hours
          being the absolute minimum for your body to function normaly, though many
          are unaware of this. Lack of sufficient sleep can lead to
          difficulties in concentration and increased risks of depression,
          heart disease, and obesity. Unfortunately, many people do not get
          enough sleep.

          Research by Gerard Kerkhof, a professor at the University of
          Amsterdam, revealed that people in the Netherlands sleep an
          average of 7 hours per night. Additionally, one-third of the
          population sleeps less than 6 hours a night, and 33 percent
          report having trouble sleeping more than three times a week. But how do we motivate children to
          sleep in a time where digital products are all around us?</p>

        <h2>How do we help children manage screentime?</h2>
      </article>
      <article id="descriptive">
        <p>Changing the behavior of an 8-year-old is not easy, especially
          if it involves a hobby they really love, like gaming. With the
          Game Changer, we aim to reward children when they manage their
          time well. Lets paint a narrative.</p>

        <p>It's 7:30 PM, and your 8-year-old, Alex, is absorbed in their
          favorite video game. Bedtime is at 8:00 PM, and you’ve
          already given a 15-minute warning that gaming time is almost over.
          However, as the clock ticks closer to bedtime, Alex becomes more
          resistant to the idea of shutting down the game.</p>

        <h2>Let the child have 'control'</h2>
      </article>
      <article id="descriptive">
        <p>A big design challenge for us was how to change the child's
          behavior in a positive way. We ourselves like playing games,
          and we understand that breaking the flow can lead to unwanted
          behavior. Our first thought was to make a timer. With a timer,
          the child has something that can't be argued with, but we knew a
          timer alone is not enough. So, we decided to add some game aspects
          to the product.
        </p>
        <img src="img/gc7.png" alt="">

        <p>The parent will decide the amount of time that the child is allowed to play,
          but the child can decide when to stop. If there is time left over, the
          remaining time will be collected and can be redeemed later. This way, the
          child can learn to manage screen time and use the saved time on a later
          date when they have more free time.

        <h2>Controls</h2>

      <article id="descriptive">
        <p>To control the device, we were limited to a few buttons and one screen, so we
          decided on a playful design by giving the chicken some glasses for the screen
          and the beak as a button that could be turned and pressed.
