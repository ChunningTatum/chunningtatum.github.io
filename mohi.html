        <h2>Mohi</h2>
        <p>In this challenge I will be focussing on the challenge: 
            “Information structure: How can we improve the user experience 
            of the information architecture of all the different elements 
            of the application.” In this challenge I will be brainstorming 
            about the IA of the app, how the userflow, if the labelling is 
            correct, and testing & interviewing users to see if the app 
            works as is intended.

            How can we improve the information architecture of the app Mohi? 
            Right now the app is difficult to use for the users that have been 
            tested. I want to design an infrastructure that is intuitive 
            for the user, so the user spends less time looking around, 
            searching for features.

            <h3>What is Mohi?</h3>
            <p>Today’s social media is full of noise and distractions that 
                actually lead to more isolated and unhappy lives. With Mohi 
                we want to build the world’s first ‘Slow Media’ platform where 
                people can organize their digital lives and strengthen 
                relationships by sharing their favorite content experiences. 
                On this platform, users are able to save some of their favorite 
                content (articles, books, podcasts, movies, series, documentaries, 
                songs) and share their selection of highlights with their inner 
                circle. In this way, Mohi becomes the app where you can always 
                find the best content recommendations from people you trust.

            <h3>First look at Mohi</h3>
            <p>By casually browsing the Mohi app and using it, I have noticed 
                that a lot of the functionality did not work as intended. The 
                app was confusing to use and most of the time the app did not 
                do things I thought it would. Understanding this I decided to 
                redesign the information architecture of the app. The user 
                shouldn’t press every button there is to find a certain 
                functionality so that’s why I have decided to improve the IA 
                structure.
            </p>
            <h3>Insights after use:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What or who are curators?</li>
                <li>Why do only curators have a ‘Bio’?</li>
                <li>Why can’t I look at other people’s top 5?</li>
                <li>The UI is kind of confusing and not suitable for users with a vision impairment.</li>
                <li>Why does Saved for later have its own tab in the navigation?</li>
                <li>It is kind off hard to search for certain functionality because the labels are not clear to me.</li>

            <h3>User research</h3>
            <p>Before improving the IA structure, we need to know how users use 
                the app and we decided to look for people to interview. In the 
                interview we will be asking beta users that have been using the 
                app and other people that might be interested in the app.
            </p>
            <p>In our interview, people mostly use Instagram and YouTube, thus I
                will be analysing these social media apps. I will also be analysing 
                Facebook, because the target audience will be people at the age of 30 
                – 40 years. Based on interviews and AI structure analysis of YouTube, Instagram 
                and Facebook, I came up with this structure.

            <ul>
                <li>Users do not understand what Mohi means.</li>
                <li>Users do not understand what Curators mean.</li>
                <li>It takes a lot of time for the users to navigate to certain functionalities, they are difficult to find.</li>
                <li>There are a lot of things that don’t work the way it was intended.</li>
                <li>The saved for later button on the navigation should move to a different place.</li>
                <li>Labels should have a better desicription.</li>
                <li>There was a suggestion to see how Instagram’s IA structure works.</li>
                <li>There should be a better way to show users what kind of content they can share.</li>

            <h3>Validating concept</h3>
            <p>To verify my designs, I planned in new interviews and testing. 
                In these tests I will be testing two different kind of users. 
                The first group of testers are the people I have interviewed 
                before, these users already have used the beta app and already 
                know how the app works. The first group of testers are to test 
                that the new design is a improvement. The second group of testers 
                are in the target group of the app and have never used the beta 
                before, so they will be going into the app blind without prior 
                knowledge.
            </p>
            <h3>Test insights:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Beta users clear almost all the test under 2 minutes</li>
                <li>The Highlight of the month part might need to be placed elsewhere</li>
                <li>The add content button does work and it shows from user research, but from design critique and feedback from teachers, it is discussable if it is the best place to be placed in.</li>
                <li>All the users I have tested are able to understand and find the functions that the Mohi has. These tasks are also done in times faster than the app right now.</li>
